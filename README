This is a utility for Android: Netrunner, a living card game published
by Fantasy Flight Games.

Currently it's just a card list and it's a couple of packs out of date.

Bootstrap the project by running `autoconf -i`, then `./configure`,
then `make`, then `./cyberfeeder --data-dir data`.

You will need autoconf, automake, gperf, gtk+3 and jansson.
